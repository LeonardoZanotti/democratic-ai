# Democratic voting AI
Machine Learning project that uses the principle of democracy to predict the final result.
Basically, we have many models of AIs, each one with different predictions and scores for the predictions, so, we will take all these predictions and get the average result with higher score in our final result, more or less like a democratic voting system.
